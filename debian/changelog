zeromq (4.0.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Updated CURVE mechanism to track revised RFC 27 (INITIATE vouch).
    The INITIATE command vouch box is Box[C',S](C->S') instead of
    Box[C'](C->S), to reduce the risk of client impersonation, as per
    https://codesinchaos.wordpress.com/2012/09/09/curvecp-1/.
  * Fixed LIBZMQ-567, adding abstract namespaces for IPC sockets on Linux.
    Converts an initial strudel or "at sign" (@) in the Unix socket path to
    a NULL character ('\0') indicating that the socket uses the abstract
    namespace instead of the filesystem namespace. For instance, binding a
    socket to 'ipc://@/tmp/tester' will not create a file associated with
    the socket whereas binding to 'ipc:///tmp/tester' will create the file
    /tmp/tester. See issue 567 for more information.
  * Added zmq_z85_encode and zmq_z85_decode to core libzmq API.
  * Added zmq_curve_keypair to core libzmq API.
  * Bumped library ABI version to 4:0:1.
  * Bug fixes
    + Fixed some build/test errors on OS/X + Clang++.
    + Fixed LIBZMQ-565, typo in code.
    + Fixed LIBZMQ-566, dealer-to-router connections sometimes failing.
    + Fixed builds for AIX, MSVC 2008, OS/X with clang++, Solaris.
    + Improved CURVE handshake error handling.

zeromq (4.0.0~rc1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Major changes
    + New wire level protocol, ZMTP/3.0, see http://rfc.zeromq.org/spec:23.
      Does not yet implement the SUBSCRIBE, CANCEL, PING, and PONG commands.
    + New security framework, from plain user+password to strong encryption,
      see section below. See http://hintjens.com/blog:49 for a tutorial.
    + New ZMQ_STREAM socket type for working as a TCP client or server. See:
      tests/test_stream.cpp.
  * Improvements
    + You can now connect to an inproc:// endpoint that does not already
      exist. This means inproc:// no longer needs careful set-up, but it may
      break code that relied on the old behaviour. See:
      tests/test_inproc_connect.cpp.
    + Libzmq now checks socket types at connection time, so that trying to
      connect a 'wrong' socket type will fail.
    + New zmq_ctx_shutdown API method will shutdown a context and send ETERM
      to blocking calls, without blocking. Use zmq_ctx_term to finalise the
      process.
    + The regression test suite has been significantly extended and improved.
    + Contexts can now be terminated in forked child processes. See:
      tests/test_fork.cpp.
    + zmq_disconnect now respects the linger setting on sockets.
    + New zmq_send_const API method to send constant data (without copying).
      See: tests/test_inproc_connect.cpp.
    + Added CMake support for static libraries.
    + Added test cases for socket semantics as defined in RFCs 28, 29, 30, 31.
      See: tests/test_spec_*.cpp.
    + New socket option, ZMQ_PROBE_ROUTER triggers an empty message on connect.
      See: tests/test_probe_router.cpp.
    + New socket option, ZMQ_REQ_CORRELATE allows for correlation of replies
      from a REP socket. See: tests/test_req_correlate.cpp.
    + New socket option, ZMQ_REQ_RELAXED, lets you disable the state machine
      on a REQ socket, so you can send multiple requests without waiting for
      replies, and without getting an EFSM error. See:
      tests/test_req_relaxed.cpp.
    + New socket option, ZMQ_CONFLATE restricts the outgoing and incoming
      socket buffers to a single message. See: tests/test_conflate.cpp.
  * Deprecated Options
    + ZMQ_IPV4ONLY deprecated and renamed to ZMQ_IPV6 so that options are
      consistently "off" by default.
    + ZMQ_DELAY_ATTACH_ON_CONNECT deprecated, and renamed to ZMQ_IMMEDIATE.
      See: tests/test_immediate.cpp.
  * Security Framework
    Based on new ZMTP wire level protocol that negotiates a security
    "mechanism" between client and server before exchanging any other data.
    Security mechanisms are extensible. ZMTP defines three by default:
    + NULL - classic ZeroMQ, with no authentication. See
      http://rfc.zeromq.org/spec:23.
    + PLAIN - plain-text username + password authentication. See
      http://rfc.zeromq.org/spec:24.
    + CURVE - secure authentication and encryption based on elliptic curve
      cryptography, using the Curve25519 algorithm from Daniel Bernstein and
      based on CurveCP's security handshake. See http://rfc.zeromq.org/spec:25,
      http://rfc.zeromq.org/spec:26, and http://curvecp.org.
      Authentication is done by pluggable "authenticators" that connect to libzmq
      over an inproc endpoint, see http://rfc.zeromq.org/spec:27.
    + Socket options to configure PLAIN security on client or server:
      ZMQ_PLAIN_SERVER, ZMQ_PLAIN_USERNAME, ZMQ_PLAIN_PASSWORD. See
      tests/test_security_plain.
    + Socket options to configure CURVE security on client or server:
      ZMQ_CURVE_SERVER, ZMQ_CURVE_PUBLICKEY, ZMQ_CURVE_SECRETKEY,
      ZMQ_CURVE_SERVERKEY. See tests/test_security_curve.cpp.
     + Socket options to configure "domain" for ZAP handler:
       ZMQ_ZAP_DOMAIN, see tests/test_security_null.cpp.
     + Support for encoding/decoding CURVE binary keys to ASCII:
       zmq_z85_encode, zmq_z85_decode.
  * Other issues addressed in this release
    + LIBZMQ-525 Multipart upstreaming from XSUB to XPUB
